# System-MBN-Example
Whole-network Matrix Bayesian Network (MBNpy) using component failure priors (X1–X22). Defines segment-level marginal failure/success probabilities, builds a system node S6 conditioned on all components, and runs variable elimination to compute the network-level marginal P(S6=fail) and P(S6=success).
